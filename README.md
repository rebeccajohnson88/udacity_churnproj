# Predict Customer Churn 

This is the first project of the [Udacity ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821) which tests lessons in the Clean Code Principles module.

## Project Description

In this project, our goal is to (1) predict which credit card customers are most likely to "churn" (attrit from membership) and (2) explore top predictors of churn using a set of financial and demographic variables.

Beyond the substantive focus, the project tests clean code principles, including logging and writing tests for user-defined functions.
